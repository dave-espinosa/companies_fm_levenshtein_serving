## 1. Environment preliminary settings

- Create a directory in some known location, in your computer.
- Inside the previous directory, clone this repo. Here is some [guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Enable the 'venv'. [This](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a classic approach, but it depends on your text editor / IDE: some of them do it for you. Check in their official documentation.
- Set yourself at the root of the 'venv', and run the following commands, one at time:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Enter all the required fields.
- You should be able to start developing.
